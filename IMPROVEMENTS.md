# DresoKB Code Improvements Summary

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Path Validation
- Added comprehensive path validation in `utils.py` to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Validates that files are within allowed directories (project, home folders, temp)
- Checks file existence and type before processing

### 2. Environment Variable Validation
- Added validation for required Azure OpenAI environment variables at startup
- Validates endpoint URL format
- Provides clear error messages for missing configuration

### 3. Input Validation
- Added command-line argument validation
- Validates max difficulty parameter
- Better error handling for invalid inputs

### 4. PDF Processing Limits
- Added file size limit (50MB) for PDF processing
- Added page count limit (100 pages)
- Prevents processing of excessively large files

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Code Organization
Refactored monolithic `__main__.py` (408 lines) into separate modules:
- `models.py` - Data models (QAItem, QADataset, QualityAssessment)
- `utils.py` - Utility functions (validation, file I/O)
- `extractors.py` - Question extraction logic
- `quality.py` - Quality control filtering
- `pdf_processor.py` - Enhanced with size limits

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between CLI, business logic, and utilities
- Easier to test individual components
- Better code reusability

### 3. Error Handling
- Proper exception types for different errors
- Better error messages for users
- Graceful handling of failures

## Testing Improvements

### 1. Test Coverage
- Increased from 53% to 73% coverage
- Added new test files:
  - `test_utils.py` - Tests for utility functions
  - `test_cli.py` - Tests for CLI functionality

### 2. Test Quality
- Tests for security features (path validation, environment variables)
- Tests for error scenarios
- Better mocking for external dependencies

## Code Quality

### 1. Type Safety
- All functions have proper type hints
- Better IDE support and error detection

### 2. Code Style
- Consistent formatting with ruff
- Fixed all linting issues
- Clean imports and organization

## Remaining Tasks

While significant improvements have been made, some areas could benefit from further work:

1. **Logging**: Implement structured logging instead of print statements
2. **Progress Indicators**: Add progress bars for long operations
3. **Performance**: Optimize batch processing sizes dynamically
4. **Integration Tests**: Add end-to-end tests with real Azure OpenAI calls
5. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to all functions

## Usage

The refactored code maintains the same CLI interface:
```bash
python -m dresokb2 <file_path> [--max-difficulty N]
```

But now with better validation, security, and error handling.
